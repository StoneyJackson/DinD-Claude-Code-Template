# Session Summary: GitHub License Recognition Fix

**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Topic**: Resolving GitHub license recognition issue

## Problem
GitHub was not recognizing the project's license despite having a REUSE-compliant `LICENSES/MIT.txt` file.

## Discussion
- User asked about GitHub not recognizing the license
- Investigated current license setup: found `LICENSES/MIT.txt` (REUSE format)
- Discussed three solutions:
  1. Create standard `LICENSE` file (copy from LICENSES/MIT.txt)
  2. Create symlink from `LICENSE` to `LICENSES/MIT.txt`
  3. Add license metadata to package.json (Node.js only)
- User asked if second solution would work for GitLab too
- Confirmed symlink approach works for both GitHub and GitLab while maintaining REUSE compliance

## Actions Taken
1. Created symlink: `LICENSE -> LICENSES/MIT.txt`
2. Verified symlink creation with `ls -la LICENSE`

## Commands Used
```bash
find . -name "LICENSE*" -o -name "COPYING*" -o -name "license*"
ls -la LICENSES/
ls -la | grep -i license
ln -s LICENSES/MIT.txt LICENSE
ls -la LICENSE
```

## Outcome
- ✅ LICENSE symlink created successfully
- ✅ Maintains REUSE compliance
- ✅ Should work for both GitHub and GitLab license recognition
- ✅ Single source of truth maintained in `LICENSES/MIT.txt`

## Key Decisions
- Chose symlink approach over copying to maintain single source of truth
- Preserved REUSE specification compliance
- Solution works across multiple Git hosting platforms

## Follow-up Items
- Commit and push changes to verify license recognition on remote platforms
